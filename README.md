# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

RPSLS is a variation of the classical game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" that adds two more options, Lizard and Spock. The game is played by two players (in this case, one human and one computer) who simultaneously choose one of the five options. The outcome of the game is determined by the following rules: 
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock
- Rock crushes lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes scissors
- Scissors decapitates lizard
- Lizard eats paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes rock
- And as it always has, Rock crushes scissors

## Features

- User interface for playing the game against computer.
- Five different options to choose from (Rock ,Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock).
- Scoreboard for numbers of wins.
- Display of the results of each round.

## Gameplay

- To play the game, the user clicks one of the five buttons. The user's choice and outcome of the computer's randomly generated choice are compared and the outcome of the game is displayed in two screens (scoreboard) and results for each round will be displayed below. 
- The game continues until one of the scores reaches 5 points. A message will be dissplayed declaring the winner and a "Play Again" button will appear which will reset the score score when clicked and reset the game.

## Testing 

- The code has been thuroughly tested throughout development to ensure that all the buttons give the desired outcome, the scoreboard will display the outcome accurately and the site is responsive on all screens.

## Bugs during development

- "Play Again" Button would not appear after a game was won or lost, requiring the user to refresh the site to reset the game.
- Once the "Play Again" button did appear, it did not function as intended. 
- The Buttons did not function at all, they would not increment the score nor would they interact with the site at all.
